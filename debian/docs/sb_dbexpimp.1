.SH NAME
sb_dbexpimp.py \- Bayes database export/import
.SH DESCRIPTION
This utility has the primary function of exporting and importing
a spambayes database into/from a CSV file.  This is useful in a number
of scenarios.
.IP
Platform portability of database \- CSV files can be exported and
imported across platforms (Windows and Linux, for example).
.IP
Database implementation changes \- databases can survive database
implementation upgrades or new database implementations.  For example,
if a dbm implementation changes between python x.y and python x.y+1...
.IP
Database reorganization \- an export followed by an import reorgs an
existing database, <theoretically> improving performance, at least in
some database implementations.
.IP
Database sharing \- it is possible to distribute particular databases
for research purposes, database sharing purposes, or for new users to
have a 'seed' database to start with.
.IP
Database merging \- multiple databases can be merged into one quite
easily by specifying \fB\-m\fR on an import.  This will add the two database
nham and nspams together and for wordinfo conflicts, will add spamcount
and hamcount together.

.IP
\fB\-f\fR: FN : flat file to export to or import from
\fB\-p\fR: FN : name of pickled database file to use
\fB\-d\fR: FN : name of dbm database file to use
\fB\-m\fR     : merge import into an existing database file.  This is
.IP
meaningful only for import. If omitted, a new database
file will be created.  If specified, the imported
wordinfo will be merged into an existing database.
Run dbExpImp \fB\-h\fR for more information.

.PP
If neither \fB\-p\fR nor \fB\-d\fR is specified, then the values in your configuration
file (or failing that, the defaults) will be used.  In this way, you may
convert to and from storage formats other than pickle and dbm.
